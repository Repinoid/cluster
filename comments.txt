IMPORTANT
To allow Trino to write to a Hive database, the user name specified while connecting to Trino (for example, via Trino CLI tool or DBeaver) 
must match the Unix user on the ADH host with sufficient permissions to write to Hive warehouse directories in HDFS. Otherwise, you may observe a similar error:

Failed to create external path hdfs://adh/apps/hive/warehouse/trino_demo_schema1.db for database trino_demo_schema1. 
This may result in access not being allowed if the StorageBasedAuthorizationProvider is enabled: null
